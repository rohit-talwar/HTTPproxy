 3.b if so make a conditional req
 3.c else send normal req
4. wait to receive data

Data structures used

We have used a map to store the requested url. The URL is mapped to a integer and the name of the file in which (if caching is on) the data will be saved


Cache Design:

Consistent Objects- 

1. Folder - ProxyServerCache
	Contains upto 100 html files
2. LogFile.txt
	Contains the log data

No Temporary files created as such

The map gets destroyed and a new map is created when the user restarts the client program.
The map contains the mapping information - i.e the knowledge about what file contains which urlï¿½s data

The data can be interpreted by any browser.
